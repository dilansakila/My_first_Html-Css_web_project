<P>
The four sites of the Buddha statues of the Gal Vihara area unit are referred to as “caves”, although the 3 vast ones aren't announced below rock secure however sculptured in partially artificial rock niches, except from the one tiny Buddha image sitting in an exceeding cave so. 
The Gal Vihara rock measures fifty-two m (170 ft) long, on the twenty-six m long centerpiece, the rock is ten m high, it then falls away step by step towards every finish.
</p>

<p>
Sockets take away the rock simply behind the sculptures indicate that the walls had originally separated the statue from each other.
consequently, remnants of brick foundations walls testify that every one of the four figures was enshrined in an exceedingly separate image house. 
the pictures weren't supposed to embellish a rock surface picturesquely however to be honored within shrine rooms, 3 of them with rounded brick walls. 
Those “cave rooms” were solely lit by tiny windows and visible light. This means, originally the large statues weren't as exposed to sunshine as these days. 
The figures were once plastered and painted in the same manner as different pictures in Sri Lanka’s cave temples.
</p>

<p>
The south of the four “caves” is Vijjadhara Guha, additionally transcribed Vijjadhdharaguha. 
the massive artificial niche contains the island’s largest ancient image of a sedent Buddha, mensuration four.6 m (15 ft. 2.5 in) tall. 
The serene finely carven Vijjadharaguha Buddha Image is considered one of Asia’s best specimens of seated rock statues in the slightest degree. 
It’s pruning five m (17 feet.) for the shrine of the large inactive Buddha sculpture.
</p>

 <p>
The seated  Vijjadharaguha sculpture is pictured within the common meditation gesture, that is named Samadhi gesture or Dhyani gesture, each hands area unit placed on the lap, paw on left with fingers totally stretched. 
The flame-like image of enlightenment over the top of Buddha is named Siraspata.

The imposing rock-cut Vijjadharaguha figure sits on a throne, an Asana, the front of that is adorned with lions and thunderbolt symbols. 
The latter area unit is noteworthy, as a result of “Vajras”, as they're referred to as, area unit indicating the influence of the Tantric kind of Buddhism, that is otherwise even additional alien to the Polonnaruwa art than to the previous Anuradhapura amount.
</br>
Behind the top of the Vijjadharaguha Buddha could be a bas-relief of a halo. 
the complete figure is framed by a relief within the form of Associate in Nursing arch, that is named Prabhamandala in Indian art. It resembles a Torana, a wood gate, that is richly decorated. Heads of the legendary crocodile dragons referred to as Makara's is seen sticking on either facet, holding tiny lions in their mouths. 
The higher a part of the arch carries tiny celestial palaces or shrines with bas reliefs portrayal Buddhas in their front niches or entrances.  
</p>




<p>
Due to some Tantrik symbolism of the posture and therefore the Prabhamandala, it's been speculated that the Vijjadharaguha Buddha doesn't represent the historical Buddha Shakyamuni however the cosmic Buddha Vairocana, one among the eternal Adibuddhas in Tantrik Buddhism. 
The four tiny pictures of Buddhas or Bodhisattvas, all of them in Samadhi gesture, too, might then represent the four directions of the universe, like during a Tantrik figure.
</p>

<h3>Cave Statue - Nisinnapatima Guha </h3>

<div class="trans">

</div>

<p> 
There is just one cave area at the Gal Vihara that is holy out of the solid rock as a whole shrine area, mistreatment the rock as its ceiling. Presumably, this was a natural cave by artificial means enlarged to an oblong cave area. 
The Prakrit name is Nisinnapatimaguha. This supposed “Excavated Cave” of Polonnaruwa’s Gal Vihara is the sole example of AN ancient drop Ceylon, which is semisynthetic and so resembling Buddhist cave temples of a land Asian country. 
Traces of wall paintings may be seen on the walls of the Nisinnapatimaguha cave, too.
</p>
<p>
The Excavated Cave, too, homes a rock-carved sedent Buddha sculpture in Samadhi gesture. measurement one.4 m (4 ft. 7 in.) tall, the image within the cave is in fact abundant smaller in size than the neighboring Vijjadharaguha Buddha, however, it’s excellently inscribed and charming so. 
This rock-cut image is seated on AN nearly one m high pedestal, a Padmasana, which suggests “Lotos Seat”. The Nisinnapatimaguha Buddha is delineated underneath a shade. 
solely the body of this inactive Buddha is framed by a Prabhamandala arch, that is of a rectangular kind. Makara-Dragons are displayed in AN upright position. Besides the foot of the arch, there are 2 noteworthy figures portraying attendants with flywhisks. 
Flywhisks are referred to as “chamara” or “prakirnaka” in Indian art. Tantric Buddhism, represents the sweeping away of obstacles to enlightenment. In Hindu art, flywhisks are emblems of royal dignity and sovereignty.

The halo closes the top is clearly marked. On either facet of the top are minuscule pictures of Brahma to the correct and Vishnu to the left of the Nisinnapatimaguha Buddha, each guardian deities are delineated four-armed.

</p>

<h3>Reclining Buddha of Polonnaruwa - Nipannapatima Guha </h3>

<div class="trans">
<img src="photos/4511571.jpg" align="right" width="100%" style="margin-left:10px; margin-bottom:10px;" />
</div>

<p> 
Sri Lanka’s painting Gal Vihara Reclining Buddha is fourteen m (46 ft) long. In spite of the stupendous dimensions, the sculpture is swish and resonates with peace. The liquid flow of the robes over the body has been abundant loved.

The soles of the Buddha's feet square measure adorned with lotus blossom and alternative auspicious marks of royalty or Buddhahood.
</p>



<p>
Typically for the Polonnaruwa amount, the Gal Vihara Reclining Buddha contains a spherical face with a high forehead. The feet don't seem to be entirely parallel because it would be for sleeping Buddhas. The left foot of the religious mystic resting on the correct is slightly drawn back.
In Buddhist ikon, this can be a feature marking the instant of the passing-away and attaining the ultimate Nirvana. that is termed Mahaparinirvana in Sanskrit and Mahaparinibbana in Prakrit.

There is a discussion if this can be all the same an outline of a sleeping Buddha rather than an Associate in Nursing expiring Buddha. the explanation is: If the upright standing sculpture near isn't Ananda, then there aren't any attendants. Earlier Indian representations of the Mahapariniravana sometimes show Ananda and a few a lot of disciples standing at the feet of the religious mystic.
</P>

<p>
The sleeping Buddha could be a far more common motive in Sri Lankan art than the expiring Buddha. this can be why some interpret this image as an outline of a sleeping Buddha within the alleged “Lion Posture” (Sihasana or Sinhasana). It’s additionally referred to as the “pose of the sleeping lion” because the lion sleeps resting its head on its paw.

The Buddha rests his head on Associate in Nursing's intricately adorned cylindrical pillow, the carving of that is rigorously dead. it's a small depression below the burden of the pinnacle. The pillow is adorned with the Chakra, the eternal wheel. The terribly center of the pillow shows an alleged “Lion-Face” (Kirthimukha).

The alleged “Cave of Reclining Image” (“Nipannapatima Guha”) was so a picture house with brick walls on 3 sides. The image house once sheltering this spectacular decumbent sculpture had its own separate entrance and 2 windows in addition.

</p>


</br>




<h3>Standing Gal Vihara Statue - Utthitapatima Guha </h3>

<div class="trans">
<img src="photos/5984625.jpg" align="left" width="100%" style="margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:10px;"/>
</div>

<p> 
The rock-cut sculpture maybe a seven m (23 ft) tall sculpture. It’s a masterpiece of art and stonemasonry. 
The identity of the standing figure of Polonnaruwa’s Gal Vihara cluster is one of the foremost controversial problems in Buddhist humanities. 
widespread belief additionally as several educated tour guides contemplate it to be an outline of Ananda, the Buddha’s favorite adherent, mourning beside the reclining Buddha sculpture, 
that undoubtedly represents the loss of the Master. however, it's rather more doubtless, that this mystic standing rock sculpture of Gal Vihara may be a Buddha image.
</p>

<p>
The 78th chapter of the Mahawansa (belonging to the half known as Chulavansa) states that Parakrama caused crafty workmen to create 3 caves within the rock, the cave of the spirits of information, 
the cave of the sitting image, and also the cave of the sleeping image. No mention is created of the standing image. however the brick foundation might give proof this separate cave with the standing image was a later addition, 
simply to feature a "standing posture" to the already existing sedent and reclining ones so as to assemble all 3 common postures of Buddha statues inland. 
Others explain the missing reference within the chronicles in barely the alternative way: The standing image is earlier, perhaps from the constant amount as Sri Lanka’s different rock-hewn standing like Aukana Buddha. each the latter clarification isn't entirely convincing. 
The sorts of the upright hymenopterous insect in the near lying sculpture in Polonnaruwa area unit quite similar, notably the spherical face and also the elaborate however terribly skinny garment of the standing sculpture agree on those of the opposite Gal Vihara statues rather more than those of rock-cut statues from the previous Anuradhapura amount.  
</p>

<p>
The main reason for the contestation and for distinguishing this marvelous sculpture as Ananda is the gesture of crossing the hands on the chest. Sri Lanka’s most famed archeologist, Senarat Paranavitana, was of the opinion that it represents the Buddha himself in grief, particularly as Paradukkha-dukkha, this is often bereft for the sorrows of others. Similarly, different authors believe that this Buddha sculpture depicts the Buddha’s nice compassion towards all sentient beings, which is named “Maha Karuna”.

Today’s most generally accepted theory was proposed by academicians. Leelananda Prematilleke, former Head of the illustrious Department of anthropology of the University of Peradeniya and coordinative Director of the UN agency - land Project of the Cultural Triangle. 
He assumed that the upright sculpture of Gal Vihara represents the Buddha within the second week once attaining enlightenment. He spent on paying regard to the Bodhi tree and also the lotus seat below the tree. so a Bodhi tree was planted recently there by the custodians of the Cultural Triangle Project.

<h3>Gal Vihara rock inscription - and Parakramabahu's monastic reform </h3>

<div id="block-1">

</div>


<p> 
Next to the doorway of Excavated Cave (Nisinnapatima Guha) is the far-famed Gal Vihara inscription on the sloping rock between the cave and also the standing image. 
It’s one of Sri Lanka’s longest ancient inscriptions in any respect. It contains the records of King Parakramabahu I. regarding his assembly of a Buddhist council in 1165 so as to revive the order by the institution of rules permanently conduct and monastic discipline. 
Many monks, the UN agency had youngsters or were engaged in magic rituals, that aren't in accordance with the Vinaya rules of the Sangha, were expelled from the Buddhist order.
In explicit, this Gal Vihara rock inscription mentions the king's efforts to unite the Buddhist order below one Nikaya tradition, that of the traditional Mahavihara.
</p>

<p>
Convening a council, purifying the order from monks’ unhealthy conduct, unifying the Sangha moreover as recording this within the inscription, all of this belongs to a convention of serious Buddhist kings established by none aside from the far-famed Indian Emperor Ashoka within the third century B.C.E. once periods of corruption of monastic discipline, necessary Sri Lankan Kings were engaged in restructuring the Sangha. 
Parakramabahu the nice is the best example. Such edicts are referred to as Katikavata in Sri Lankan history.
</br>
Accordingly, the text quotes the king: “Seeing, once more and once more, a blot on the stainless Buddhist faith if a would possibly monarch like myself were to stay indifferent the faith might change state and lots of living beings would be destined for hell. 
Let Maine serve the faith that it would last thousand years”.
</p>

<p>
The new code of conduct for monks was demanded with the assistance of the foremost famed monk of the Polonnaruwa amount, Mahakassapa from Dimbulagala, UN agency followed the Theravadic traditions of Sri Lanka’s most ancient religious residence, the Mahavihara in Anuradhapura. Mahakassapa became the “Sangharaja”, the “King of the Buddhist Order”. tho' the amount of a unified Sangha below a stratified leadership disappeared once more with the autumn of Polonnaruwa, there's one inheritance of Parakramabahu’s Sangha reform lasting in Ceylon until the current day. 
it had been from Parakramabahu’s Buddhist Council forward, that the Buddhism faculty of Buddhism, the “Elders’ Teaching”, has been the only accepted sort of Buddhism on the island. during this respect, the importance of the events recorded within the Gal Vihara inscription can't be underestimated for the culture of Ceylon and on the far side.
</br>
That the Sri Lankan Buddhist tradition was commanded in high esteem throughout that amount, are often learned from the account of a Tibetan envoy UN agency visited Bodhgaya, the holiest place of worship in Bharat for all Buddhists. His report from 1235 states, he counted three hundred Sinhalese monks at the Buddhist main shrine, UN agency was guilty of keeping the sacred place intact.

<b>
Actually, the Vinaya rules set down by Gautama Buddha himself don't enable the intervention of laymen like kings into affairs of the Sangha. 
Of course, a king has no authority to vary or proclaim monastic rules. The Katikavatas didn't alter the canonical Vinaya however introduced further rules for securing the observance of the initial Vinaya rules. 
for instance, King Parakramabahu ordained that new ordination ceremonies had to be controlled solely within the capital, Polonnaruwa, on a selected competition day and within the presence of the king. the foremost necessary administrational means that for securing monastic discipline was that monks had to amass a certificate from the king. 
This meant, nobody might incorrectly claim to be a monk any longer, because it had happened antecedently. This follow of royal or governmental certifications for monks could be a follow that was borrowed from the Sri Lankan Katikavata tradition in alternative Buddhism Buddhist countries, too, in earth geographical area, notably in Siam. 
even so, in follow, this meant that a common man, the king, was able to decide World Health Organization might become a monk. and really, this can be not in accordance with the initial Vinaya rule of Gautama Buddha, which stressed the strict autonomy of the order, particularly regarding the admission of recent members of the Sangha. moreover, Parakramabahu’s rule that the leadership of the capital’s cloister was accountable of regional and native communities of monks, is against the choice of words and spirit of the initial Vinaya rule of Gautama Buddha World Health Organization ordained, that every one competencies area unit attributed to the native congregations. 
Indeed, Gautama Buddha appears to own meant to avoid a hierarchical data structure in favor of the democratic autonomy of every monastic community.
